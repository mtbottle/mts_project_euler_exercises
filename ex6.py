#The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
#1^(2) + 2^(2) + ... + 10^(2) = 385

#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
#(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025

#Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

#Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
